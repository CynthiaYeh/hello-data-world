# Hello Data World!
This is Cynthia's portfolio, presenting all the data work I have done.

I am a recent graduate majoring in MS Biostatistics from NYU. I love telling story, and that is why I am passionate about explaining data in a clear and creative manner. I am proficient in R and Python, familiar with STATA and SAS, and have conducted several data analysis projects and machine learning projects. I am currently searching for full-time position as a Data Scientist/Data Analyst, hoping to use statistical methods to solve the real-world issues in terms of technology and health industry.
